## Developers Word

It is my side portofolio project designed for mastering database and Laravel framework concepts.
Main goal here is placed on SQL, database design including the database documentation followed in ``docs`` folder on the repository.
All the code is on single repository, including **React** frontend.

For the frontend I choose React, because it is the most popular, along with its **schadCN** library.
**Inertia** is used as a glue between Laravel and React.

I just took over one of the Laravel's starter templates, which includes following libraries to care less about the architecture and more about building the actual app.

## Stack

- **Backend:** Laravel (PHP)  
- **Frontend:** React + Inertia.js + SchadCN UI components  
- **Database:** MySQL / MariaDB  
- **Authentication:** Laravel Sanctum (optional token-based auth)  
- **Testing:** PHPUnit / Feature tests

---

## Goals

- Build a **stable and scalable core backend**  
- Implement migrations, models, and relationships with best practices  
- Provide clean APIs for future frontend, mobile, or third-party integrations  
- Maintain a **modular architecture** for easy future expansion  
- Focus on **documentation and maintainability** as the backbone of the system

---

## Future Extensions

- Enhanced user and publisher features  
- News feeds and activity streams  
- Analytics and reporting  
- Frontend improvements and additional UI components

---

## Notes

This repository represents the **single source of truth** for all backend logic.  
Frontend is decoupled through Inertia.js and can be migrated to a separate repository if needed.  
The system is designed to scale and support additional features without major refactoring.
